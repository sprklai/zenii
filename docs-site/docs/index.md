# Zenii Documentation

**20 megabytes. AI everywhere.**

Install one binary. Now your scripts have **AI memory**. Your cron jobs **reason**. Your Telegram bot **thinks**. A private AI backend for everything on your machine — native desktop app, plugins in any language, and an API your `curl` can call.

> *"ChatGPT is a tab you open. Zenii is a capability your machine gains."*

## What is Zenii?

Zenii is a local AI backend that gives every tool on your machine access to AI — through a single binary, a 109-route REST/WebSocket API, and a native desktop app. No cloud account, no SDK, no framework to learn. Just HTTP.

- **For developers** — `curl` the API from scripts, cron jobs, CI pipelines, or any language
- **For power users** — desktop app, CLI, and TUI for interactive AI chat with persistent memory
- **For teams** — self-hosted, MIT licensed, zero telemetry, encrypted credential storage
- **For tinkerers** — plugin system in any language (Python, Go, JS) via JSON-RPC over stdio

### Key capabilities

| Capability | What it means |
|-----------|--------------|
| **109 API routes** | Full REST + WebSocket gateway at `localhost:18981` |
| **18 AI providers** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, and more — switch with one config change |
| **Semantic memory** | SQLite FTS5 + vector search — your AI remembers across sessions and restarts |
| **17 built-in tools** | Web search, file ops, shell, scheduling, channels, workflows, and more |
| **Plugin system** | Any language, JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio — a plugin is ~15 lines |
| **Self-evolution** | AI proposes skill changes, you approve — like a PR from your assistant |
| **Workflow engine** | Multi-step TOML pipelines with DAG execution, retry policies, and template resolution |
| **Agent delegation** | Parallel sub-agent execution for complex tasks with dependency-based waves |
| **Cron scheduler** | Automated recurring AI tasks without external orchestration |
| **6-layer security** | OS keyring with encrypted file fallback, autonomy levels, FS sandbox, injection detection, rate limits, audit trail |
| **Cross-platform** | macOS, Linux, Windows, ARM — desktop, CLI, TUI, or headless daemon |
| **Under 20 MB** | Native Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 desktop app — not Electron |

### 5 ways to use it

| Interface | Best for |
|-----------|---------|
| **Desktop** | Interactive chat with GUI (Tauri 2 + Svelte 5) |
| **CLI** | Quick prompts, scripting, piping output |
| **TUI** | Terminal-native interactive UI |
| **Daemon** | Headless API server for automation and integrations |
| **Mobile** | iOS + Android (coming soon) |

All interfaces talk to the same backend — your data, memory, and configuration are shared.
