## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.14] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Plugin-based prompt strategy system with ~65% token reduction (PromptStrategy + PromptPlugin traits, CompactStrategy, LegacyStrategy, PromptStrategyRegistry)
- 6 built-in prompt plugins: Memory, UserObservations, Skills, LearnedRules, Channel, Scheduler

### Fixed
- Telegram long-polling timeout mismatch causing persistent failures
- sqlite_vec transmute for aarch64 compatibility (c_char/c_int types)
- rustfmt cross-version compatibility via `#[rustfmt::skip]`

### Changed
- Chat, WebSocket, and channel router handlers refactored to use single `prompt_strategy.assemble()` call
- Docker image publishing temporarily disabled in release workflow
- Documentation updated: installation, deployment, architecture, configuration, processes

## [0.0.13] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Notification router with desktop OS notifications and channel routing
- Per-event-type notification routing rules (desktop, channel targets)
- Desktop notification support via Tauri IPC (`showNotification` wrapper)
- GeneralSettings UI toggle for desktop notifications
- Gateway config handler for notification route CRUD
- Frontend notification store wired to WebSocket events
- TUI client with async event loop and WebSocket streaming
- Channel router with supervision, exponential backoff, and auto-reconnect
- Docker multi-arch image publishing to GitHub Container Registry
- TUI binary included in multi-platform release pipeline

## [0.0.12] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Read user location/timezone from live config instead of frozen BootContext, so onboarding location changes take effect immediately without restart

## [0.0.11] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Context-driven auto-discovery with keyword-based domain detection (Channels/Scheduler/Skills/Tools) for filtered context injection
- AgentSelfTool (`agent_notes`): agent-writable behavioral rules by category, stored in DB, auto-injected into context
- OpenAPI 3.1 interactive documentation via utoipa + Scalar UI at `/api-docs` (feature-gated `api-docs`)
- First-run onboarding flow with browser timezone auto-detection and user location input (`GET /setup/status` + SetupDialog)
- User location and timezone awareness injected into agent context for location-sensitive queries
- Model capability validation (`supports_tools` pre-check) to prevent tool-calling errors with incompatible models
- Agent reasoning protocol refinements in context composition
- Embedding availability tracking in provider registry
- `GET /config/file` endpoint for raw config file content
- `GET /setup/status` endpoint for first-run setup detection

### Changed
- Tool count: 14 base + 2 feature-gated = 16 total (added `agent_self`)
- Route count: 75 base + 17 feature-gated = 92 total

### Fixed
- rustfmt formatting issues

### Documentation
- Updated README, architecture, phases, and processes docs for all post-v0.0.10 features
- Updated test badge: 1046 Rust + 37 JS
- Added 5 new architecture sections with Mermaid diagrams
- Added 3 new process flows (onboarding, auto-discovery, agent self-learning)

## [0.0.10] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Fix release asset name collisions: standalone binaries now use platform-specific names (mesoclaw-linux, mesoclaw-macos) to prevent duplicate upload failures

## [0.0.9] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Release pipeline: exclude keyring/dbus from embedded cross-builds, fix asset name collisions, disable musl target pending OpenSSL cross-compilation fix
- Remove musl references from release checksums and artifact globs to prevent missing file warnings
- Fix GitHub Actions injection pattern in version extraction step

## [0.0.8] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Plugin system (Phase 9): manifest parser, registry with JSON persistence, JSON-RPC process manager, tool adapter, installer with git integration, and 8 gateway API endpoints

### Fixed
- Clippy warnings breaking CI: duplicate cfg gate on local_embeddings, missing transmute annotations in boot.rs

## [0.0.7] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Security hardening: CORS origins, credential exposure, path traversal, shell injection, error sanitization
- Concurrency hazards: DashMap guard held across await, scheduler double-start race, mutex poisoning (parking_lot)
- Channel reliability: UTF-8 safe message splitting, atomic registry operations, session caching
- First-run UX: AuthGate exponential backoff, chat no-model CTA, WebSocket reconnection
- Config state integrity: ArcSwap for hot-reload, session ordering, frontend config key alignment
- Settings truthfulness: hide phantom features (Perplexity, SerpAPI, Matrix), verify channel status
- Svelte 5 compiler warnings eliminated (19 → 0)
- FTS5 query escaping for special characters
- Skills registry duplicate key rejection
- Release pipeline: macOS code signing bypass, Windows timeout, embedded cross-compilation

### Added
- All-features CI testing (cargo test + clippy with full feature set)
- CODEOWNERS for automated review assignment
- Branch protection ruleset for main

### Changed
- Desktop devtools disabled by default (opt-in via feature flag)
- CSP tightened with script-src restriction
- Embedded builds exclude keyring feature (environment-based credentials)

## [0.0.6] - 2026-03-10
