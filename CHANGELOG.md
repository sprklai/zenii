## [0.0.44] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Add 15s timeout to browser-side fetch — prevents indefinite hangs when daemon is unresponsive in browser mode
- Fix session creation race condition — block WebSocket push events during in-flight `create()` to prevent duplicate sessions
- Add concurrent load guard (`loadVersion`) to sessions and providers stores — prevents stale data from overwriting newer state
- Add error handling with toast feedback to all async click handlers (new chat, delete, rename, memory CRUD)

## [0.0.43] - 2026-03-21

- Add 15s timeout to Tauri HTTP plugin fetch — prevents app hang on macOS when plugin is slow to init
- Add 10s timeout to Tauri WebSocket plugin connect for chat and notification streams
- Fix `$effect` re-trigger in chat page — streaming state changes no longer cause message flicker after response completes
- Fix stale message load race condition — rapid session switching no longer shows wrong session's messages
- Fix orphaned WebSocket on chat navigation — ChatView now cleans up stream on unmount
- Fix duplicate session on "New Chat" — suppress self-originated `session_created` push events that race with local creation
- Fix `bumpSession` Svelte 5 reactivity — use array reassignment instead of in-place `splice()` mutation
- Prevent duplicate session on new chat from WebSocket push race condition
- Resolve app hang and race conditions on macOS desktop

## [0.0.42] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Add `app` bundle to macOS CI for auto-updater support — `latest.json` was missing `darwin-aarch64` and `darwin-x86_64` entries because only DMG (non-updater-compatible) bundles were built
- Handle missing Desktop directory in case-insensitive path test

## [0.0.41] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- Added `tauri-plugin-http` and `tauri-plugin-websocket` to route requests through Rust, bypassing browser mixed-content policy
- Resolved 7 race conditions and concurrency bugs identified in cross-model code audit (tray shutdown, daemon SIGTERM, approval timeout cleanup, WS reconnect timer, WS warning schema, TUI error handling)

## [0.0.38] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Delegation persistence: agent task details (descriptions, tool counts, tokens, durations, status) are now stored in the database and rendered in chat history

- `description` field added to `TaskResult` for delegation agent descriptions
- Per-tool permission enforcement: AskOnce/AskAlways tools now trigger the approval gate during agent execution
- `executable_tools()` method on `PermissionResolver` — includes all non-Denied tools so AskOnce/AskAlways tools reach the approval gate
- `from_tools_full()` on `RigToolAdapter` — unified constructor wiring permissions, cache, approval, and events
- Automatic updates via `tauri-plugin-updater` — desktop app checks GitHub releases for new versions
- `dir:` and `crate:` scope options for `codex-audit` command

### Fixed
- Delegation responses now persist to the database, fixing blank screen after delegation completion

## [0.0.35] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- CLI: `workflow cancel` now uses correct route `/workflows/{id}/runs/{run_id}/cancel` (was 404ing against non-existent `/workflows/{id}/cancel`)
- CLI: `workflow run` now prints `run_id` so users can reference it for cancel
- API: channel connect endpoint returns error on connect failure instead of silent 200 OK
- Security: WebSocket connection URL no longer logs auth token to browser console

## [0.0.34] - 2026-03-20

### Added

### Fixed
- Chat: first-message race condition — `goto()` now awaited, route effect guards against clearing during active stream
- Chat: session ID closure capture — `activeStreamSessionId` prevents stale callbacks from corrupting wrong session
- Chat: synthetic message IDs — `finishStream()` reconciles with server instead of fabricating untracked messages
- Chat: manual stop no longer creates phantom assistant messages (new `cancelStream()` method)
- Desktop: graceful shutdown — sends gateway `shutdown_tx` and waits for WAL checkpoint before exit
- Boot: readiness-gated store init — `sessionsStore.load()` and `notificationStore.connect()` now wait for AuthGate readiness
- WebSocket: unknown message types no longer silently dropped (added `default` case + `onWarning` callback)
- Stores: scheduler, workflows, channels, inbox now surface errors via `error` field instead of swallowing as empty lists
- Workflows: cancel rollback — restores running state on API failure instead of silent `.catch(() => {})`
- Inbox: message deduplication on WebSocket reconnect (2-second window check)
- Notifications: `retryConnection()` method resets reconnect budget; layout shows "Reconnect" banner
- Channels: config update rollback on API failure (snapshot/restore pattern)
