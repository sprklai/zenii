# CLAUDE.md -- Zenii

## Project Overview

Zenii is a Rust workspace producing 5 binaries from a shared core:
- **Desktop** (Tauri 2 + Svelte 5), **Mobile** (Tauri 2 iOS/Android), **CLI** (clap), **TUI** (ratatui), **Daemon** (headless axum)

All clients communicate via HTTP+WebSocket gateway (axum at 127.0.0.1:18981).

## v2 Philosophy

Zenii v2 is a clean rewrite, not a patch. Core principles:

1. **Use proven crates, don't hand-roll** -- prefer battle-tested crates over custom implementations. Examples: `sysinfo` over parsing `/proc`, `websearch` over hand-rolled provider cascades, `rig-core` over custom AI agent loops, `ignore` over manual file walking. Less code to maintain, fewer platform-specific bugs.
2. **Port patterns, not code** -- v1 has good architectural patterns (trait-based tools, security policy enforcement, memory abstraction). Port the *design* and adapt to v2 conventions (`ZeniiError`, `tokio::sync`, `spawn_blocking`), don't copy-paste v1 code with its `Result<T, String>` and `std::sync::Mutex`.
3. **Lean by default** -- feature-gate optional modules (channels, scheduler, web-dashboard). Default binary includes only what's needed for core operation. Check dependency trees before adding crates.
4. **Single shared core** -- ALL business logic lives in `zenii-core`. Binary crates are thin shells (<100 lines each). No logic duplication across binaries.

## References

- **V1 Implementation**: `/home/rakesh/RD/NSRTech/Tauri/tauriclaw` — the original v1 codebase, useful for understanding existing patterns and porting logic
- **Migration Plan**: `no_commit/migrate_v1_2_v2_plan.md` — detailed plan for migrating from v1 to v2 architecture

## Strict Rules

1. **No std::sync::Mutex in async paths** -- use tokio::sync::Mutex or DashMap
2. **No block_on()** -- use tokio::spawn or .await
3. **No Result<T, String>** -- use ZeniiError enum (thiserror)
4. **All SQLite ops via spawn_blocking** -- rusqlite is sync
5. **Zero business logic in binary crates** -- everything in zenii-core
6. **No code duplication** -- if used twice, extract to zenii-core
7. **TDD: plan -> user approves -> write tests -> user approves -> implement -> cargo test -> user validates**
8. **No phase proceeds without user confirmation at all 3 gates (plan, tests, completion)**
9. **All public functions must have unit tests**
10. **Feature flags for optional modules** -- keep default binary lean
11. **Research before adding dependencies** -- search internet for crates, compare alternatives, document rationale in `plans/`
12. **Binary size matters** -- prefer lightweight crates, check dependency trees, avoid bloat
13. **Never skip the workflow** -- ALWAYS write the plan file to `plans/` and test plan file to `tests/` BEFORE writing any implementation code. Even if a plan was discussed or approved verbally in a prior session, the files must exist on disk and be presented to the user for approval before any `.rs` file is created or modified. No exceptions.

## Conventions

- Error handling: ZeniiError enum with thiserror, no `.map_err(|e| e.to_string())`
- Async: tokio::sync primitives only, never std::sync in async code
- Concurrency: DashMap for concurrent HashMaps, tokio::sync::Mutex for async locks
- Testing: `#[cfg(test)]` in same file, integration tests in `tests/`
- Naming: snake_case (Rust), camelCase (TypeScript/Svelte)
- Imports: std -> external crates -> internal modules (blank line separated)
- Logging: `tracing` macros only (info!, warn!, error!, debug!), never println!
- Frontend: max 1 `$effect` per Svelte component, WS for real-time, no polling
- **Native `<select>` in dark mode**: Always use `bg-background text-foreground` classes on `<select>` elements. The `color-scheme: dark` on `.dark` class in `app.css` ensures dropdown options render with dark backgrounds. Never use `bg-transparent` on selects — it breaks option visibility in dark mode.
- Paths: absolute in code, relative when referencing to user
- SQL: parameterized queries only, WAL mode, migrations in transactions
- Security: never log credentials, use zeroize for sensitive data, keyring for storage
- **Credential key naming**: Use colon-separated namespacing for all credential keys. AI provider API keys: `api_key:{provider_id}` (e.g., `api_key:openai`, `api_key:tavily`, `api_key:brave`). Channel credentials: `channel:{channel_id}:{field}` (e.g., `channel:telegram:token`, `channel:slack:bot_token`). Never use underscore-separated names like `tavily_api_key`.
- Structs: derive `Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize` on all public structs
- Enums: `#[non_exhaustive]` on public enums that may grow
- Async locks: never hold across `.await` points
- Testing: test success + failure paths, use `tempfile` for FS tests, mock external APIs
- **No magic numbers**: Never hardcode tunable values (weights, thresholds, limits, timeouts, ratios, intervals, sizes, retry counts, etc.) directly in business logic. Define them as fields in `AppConfig` (or a nested config section) with sensible defaults in `schema.rs`, so users can override via `config.toml`. Read from config at runtime, not compile-time constants. Examples: search scoring weights, token limits, rate-limit windows, batch sizes, cache TTLs, connection pool sizes.

## Agent Usage

Use the **Agent tool** (subagents) to parallelize work and protect context:

- **Explore agents** (`subagent_type=Explore`): Use for broad codebase research, deep file traversal, or understanding unfamiliar modules. Prefer over manual Glob/Grep when the search requires more than 3 queries.
- **Parallel task agents**: Spawn independent agents when implementing changes across unrelated modules (e.g., updating `zenii-cli` and `zenii-tui` simultaneously, or researching multiple crate alternatives at once).
- **Research agents**: Delegate dependency research, documentation lookups, or v1 codebase analysis to agents to keep the main context focused on decision-making.
- **Phase Gate agents**: During Gate 1 (Plan), use agents to research crates, scan the v1 codebase for portable patterns, and audit existing code -- all in parallel.

**When NOT to use agents**:
- Simple, directed searches (single Glob or Grep suffices)
- Sequential tasks where each step depends on the previous result
- Trivial edits to 1-2 files

**Rule**: Do not duplicate work an agent is already doing. Delegate, then use the results.

## Plan Mode Requirement

**Always start in Plan Mode** when:
- Implementing a new feature
- Starting a new phase implementation
- Making architectural changes
- Any task involving multiple files or modules

Enter plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`) first to think through the approach, identify affected files, and outline the steps before writing any code. Exit plan mode only after the plan is clear, then execute.

This prevents wasted work from wrong assumptions and ensures alignment with the Phase Gate Workflow below.

## Phase Gate Workflow

Every phase has **3 user gates** -- no skipping allowed:

1. **Gate 1 -- Plan**: Create detailed plan in `plans/phaseN_*.md`. This includes:
   - Scope, API signatures, data models, dependencies
   - **Dependency research**: Use agents to search the internet for candidate crates/libraries in parallel. Compare alternatives on: binary size impact, compile time, maintenance activity, dependency tree depth, feature completeness. Prefer lightweight crates that keep the binary lean.
   - **Tech selection rationale**: For every dependency chosen (or rejected), document *why* in the plan. Include alternatives considered, trade-offs, and size/performance implications.
   - **V1 analysis**: Use an Explore agent to scan the v1 codebase (`/home/rakesh/RD/NSRTech/Tauri/tauriclaw`) for portable patterns and logic relevant to the phase.
   - **Assumptions log**: List all assumptions with rationale. Flag any that need user confirmation.
   - Present to user. **User must approve before any code.**
2. **Gate 2 -- Tests (TDD)**: Write unit tests first based on the approved plan. Present tests to user. **User must approve test design before implementation.**
3. **Gate 3 -- Completion**: Implement -> `cargo test` -> `cargo clippy` -> present summary with diagrams. **User confirms before next phase.**
4. **Post-Gate -- Documentation**: After user confirms Gate 3, **mandatory** updates before moving on:
   - Update `docs/architecture.md` with any new modules, traits, or data flows (add/update Mermaid diagrams)
   - Update `docs/phases.md` — mark phase as `[COMPLETE]`, fill in deliverables summary
   - Update `README.md` — reflect new capabilities, commands, or structure changes
   - Update `no_commit/todo_tracker.md` — mark resolved items `[x]`, add any new TODO/STUB/FIX items discovered
   - Update `docs/processes.md` if any process flows changed

Between gates, **ask user for inputs** on design decisions, preferences, and constraints. Never assume -- wrong assumptions cost more than a question.

See `docs/phases.md` for full phase details and checklist.

## Best Practices

- **Read before write**: Always read existing code before modifying. Understand context first.
- **Minimal changes**: Only change what's needed. Don't refactor, add docs, or "improve" adjacent code.
- **Don't touch working code**: Never refactor or restructure code that already works unless the user explicitly asks for it or it's strictly necessary for the current task.
- **Validate before claiming done**: Run `cargo test --workspace && cargo clippy --workspace` -- never skip.
- **No guessing**: If unclear, ask. Wrong assumptions cost more than a question.
- **Atomic commits**: One logical change per commit. Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- **Check compilation early**: Run `cargo check` after structural changes, don't wait until the end.
- **Prefer existing patterns**: Match the style and patterns already in the codebase.
- **No dead code**: Don't leave commented-out code, unused imports, or placeholder stubs.
- **Latest packages**: Always use the latest stable versions of all dependencies (Rust crates, npm/bun packages, Tauri plugins). When adding new dependencies, check for the current latest version first. Periodically verify existing deps are up to date via `cargo upgrade --dry-run` and equivalent frontend tooling.
- **Learn from errors**: When a build/test/runtime error occurs, diagnose the root cause and save the pattern + fix to memory (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`) so the same mistake is never repeated.
- **Parallelize with agents**: When a task involves 2+ independent workstreams (e.g., researching crates, updating unrelated modules, scanning multiple directories), use agents instead of doing them sequentially.

## Documentation Requirement

After each phase completion (Gate 3 approved), update all docs before proceeding — see **Post-Gate** step in Phase Gate Workflow above. This is not optional. Files to update: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/phases.md`, `docs/processes.md`, `README.md`, `no_commit/todo_tracker.md`.

## Markdown Compatibility Rules

- **Mermaid line breaks**: Use `<br>` not `<br/>` — Mermaid 11.x Langium parser rejects self-closing `<br/>` with "Syntax error in text"
- **Mermaid parentheses**: Use `#40;` and `#41;` for `(` and `)` inside node labels — bare parentheses trigger "Unsupported markdown: list" in Mermaid 11.x. Does NOT apply to subgraph titles or sequence diagram participants — use plain text or dashes there instead.
- **Mermaid subgraph/node ID collision**: Never use the same ID for a `subgraph` and a node inside it — Mermaid treats them as the same entity and throws "Setting X as parent of X would create a cycle". Use distinct IDs, e.g. `subgraph "Boot"` with node `BootEntry[...]` instead of `Boot[...]`.
- **Mermaid numbered lists**: Never use `1.`, `2.`, etc. anywhere in node label text (including after `<br>`) — Mermaid interprets these as Markdown ordered list items and throws "Unsupported markdown: list". Use plain text without numbering, or use letters/dashes instead.
- **Directory trees**: Use Unicode box-drawing characters (`├──`, `└──`, `│`) not ASCII `+--` and `|` — the `+` is a valid Markdown list marker and triggers "unsupported list" warnings in renderers
- **Mermaid styling** (nice-to-have): For simple, non-complex diagrams, add `style` or `classDef` directives to improve readability with color. Use a consistent palette: `#4CAF50` (green/done), `#FF9800` (orange/in-progress), `#2196F3` (blue/info), `#9E9E9E` (gray/not-started), `#F44336` (red/error). Keep styling minimal — don't clutter complex diagrams. Prefer `classDef` for reusable styles over per-node `style` directives.
- **Mermaid layout**: Use `direction TB` or `direction LR` explicitly for clarity. Group related nodes with `subgraph`. Add spacing with invisible edges (`~~>`) only if layout is unreadable otherwise.

## TODO / MOCK / FIX Tracking

Track incomplete work with standardized comments in code **and** in `no_commit/todo_tracker.md`:

### In-code comment format
```rust
// TODO: <description> — <phase or context>
// MOCK: <description> — <what it replaces, when to remove>
// FIX: <description> — <what's wrong, severity>
// STUB: <description> — <what it should become>
```

### Tracker file
Maintain `no_commit/todo_tracker.md` with a table of all TODO/MOCK/FIX/STUB items. Update it whenever adding or resolving items. Format:

```markdown
| Status | Type | File | Line | Description | Phase |
|--------|------|------|------|-------------|-------|
| [ ] | TODO | path/to/file.rs | 82 | Start axum gateway | Phase 3 |
```

Statuses: `[ ]` open, `[x]` done, `[-]` won't do (with reason)
